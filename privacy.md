The Bot stores **no** data.

Interactions and options provided are logged for debugging purposes.

[Sentry](https://sentry.io) is used for error tracking. Data collected when an error occurs:

- `error`: The error message and stack trace
- `interaction`: The interaction (ex. `command: search`)
- Local stack variables
- The request method and origin (from Discord's servers)

Errors reported to Sentry are deleted after 90 days.

For a copy of your data, or to delete the data by request, you may contact the developer. Please note that you may be required to verify your identity and/or your permissions on a server before requests can be completed, to avoid unauthorized access or deletion of data.

[Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy) also applies while using Discord
